Hi Zhao,

While we did not click, copy, paste code from any source, we did use the alogorithm found in the following sources: Huffman's Algorithm and Huffman Codes. Huffman's Algorithm greatly influenced our Node class and Huffman Codes encouraged us to use a PriorityQueue. 

We also did the extra credit. It should run automatically after what the assignment asked for (single letter symbol and 2 letter symbols). Our text file given is Homer's The Iliad. It should first print out the count of every character, then a chart of the character, its probability and its encoding. Finally it will print out the calculated entropy and our actual entropy. Our calculated entropy is 4.16 and our actual entropy is 4.18. Both entropies are about 4, because it is hard to model natural language. There is a structure in our sentences, dependencies in our words and repetition in our language. Our encoding is of individual letters and not meaning. Because of the size of our text, we believe we got close to the entropy of English. However, there is most likely room for improvement.
